                            <p>As a student who has always worked hard in all academic endeavors, entering the workforce was a smooth transition. I have been referred to by my academic peers as a focused individual with good communication skills. In jobs I have been referred to as a hard working, quick learning, astute individual that knows how to carry out whatever is asked of me and readily adapt to working in groups. My work experience might not be vast, but I have applied the lessons I've learned from the working world to my everyday life and my approach to learning in college. In choosing to major in computer science I have come to understand the level of work required to not just understand but excel in the field of computer Science. with this mindset, as a college junior. In my academic studies I have learned languages like python, Unix, Machine language, and C++. C++ being the language I feel the strongest about. During my extracurricular time I have learned languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Swift.</p>
